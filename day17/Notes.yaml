Retry Tests
Flaky tests

1. Extend one of the methods (fill/click methods)
      Click <<slowdown>> - best practice
      Wrapper method -> Click after that wait for sometime (retry)

2. Retry logic to be customized (custom functions)
      - Check if the test is on retry
      - Call the wrapper method

3. Change the existing test to use the new method

GitHub Actions

Prerequisites
1. You should have a github account
2. You need to create a repo (public/private)
3. You need to connect your VS code to that repo
4. You need to configure the git yml 
5. You need to push the code to the github --> GitHub actions running the code
6. Download the result and audit!

Usecase: Every time you push the code to the git repo --> PW code (specific tasks that you configure) will run
on the allocated machines (by github actions) and the results will be available to view later
