Shadow DOM
1. Playwright can pierce the shadow root and interact with the elements
2. Playwright doesn't support XPath to locate an element present inside the shadow root

try{

} catch {

} finally {
  context.tracing.stop();
}

afterEach
{
  stop tracing
}

test.only()
test.skip(browserName){
test()
browserName ='firefox'
}

test.fail()
test.fixme()
test.slow()
test.setTimeout
test(title, callback){

}

test.info()
test.step()

test.beforeAll(async() => {
  console.log("Executed only once")
})
test.beforeEach(async() => {

})
